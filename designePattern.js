// Design Pattern for JS web app

// 1. Module Pattern
// The Module Pattern is a widely used design pattern for encapsulating code and creating private and public variables and functions.
// It promotes encapsulation, reducing the likelihood of variable and function name clashes.

// 2. Singleton Pattern
// The Singleton Pattern ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to that instance.
// This can be useful for managing global state or resources in front - end applications.

// 3. Observer Pattern
// The Observer Pattern is excellent for handling events and notifications.
// It defines a one - to - many relationship between objects, where changes in one object trigger updates in multiple dependent objects.

// 4. Factory Pattern
// The Factory Pattern is useful for creating objects without specifying the exact class of object that will be created.
// It provides a simple and flexible way to create instances.
